# Machine Learning Project: Predicting Customer Insurance Purchase

### üìö University Project - Artificial Intelligence Module 

This project was completed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence** module, during my **third year** of the **BSc in Mathematics and Data Science at Dundalk Institute of Technology**  aiming to apply AI techniques to a real-world dataset. The main objective is to predict whether a customer will purchase insurance based on various attributes using machine learning models.

## üì¶ Project Overview

- The project uses the dataset **`CUSTOMER_INSURANCE_LTV.csv`**.
- Focus areas include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and applying machine learning algorithms to predict insurance purchase.
- The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer decisions and determine the best predictive model.
- The core objective is to predict insurance purchase using AI and machine learning techniques.
- The files include all steps from raw data cleaning to model evaluation.
